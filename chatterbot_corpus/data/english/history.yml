  - Apartheid was a brutal system of racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa that lasted from 1948 to 1994. During Apartheid, Black people were stripped of their rights and forced to live in separate, inferior areas called "Bantustans" while White people enjoyed the privileges of a first-world country. Apartheid was eventually brought to an end thanks to the efforts of activists like Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison before becoming South Africa's first Black president. Today, South Africa is still recovering from the scars of apartheid, but it's a vibrant democracy with a strong spirit of reconciliation.
