- - what are the laws of thermodynamics
  - the laws of thermodynamics the bedrock of physics! These laws describe how energy behaves, and they govern everything from the behavior of molecules to the fate of the universe. There are four fundamental laws. The first law,Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The second law, In a closed system, disorder (entropy) always increases over time. This is why your room gets messier if you don’t clean it!
- - what disease does a carcinogen cause
  - cancer.
- - what is the speed of light
  - The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, or 670,616,629 miles per hour. This speed limit was first experimentally demonstrated by Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, and it's also a key component of many scientific and engineering applications, such as satellite communication and GPS. itstruly mind-boggling to think how fast light travels in such a short period of time 
- - what is a wavelength
  - wavelength is the inverse of frequency.
- - what is the size of earth
  - The Earth is pretty big, even if itsjust a small dot in the vast expanse of the universe. It has a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,917 miles) at the equator and a circumference of about 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). Compared to other planets in our solar system, Earth is actually the fifth largest, with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune being much bigger. 
- - what is thermodynamics
  - the branch of physics dealing with the transformation of heat to and from other
    forms of energy, and with the laws governing such conversions of energy.
- - who is issac newton
  - Isaac Newton was a 17th-century English physicist, mathematician, and astronomer. He is often considered one of the greatest scientists in history, and his contributions to physics, mathematics, and astronomy are truly mind-blowing. 
- - what is chemistry
  - the science of mixing chemicals.
- - what is chemistry
  - Chemistry is the study of the composition, properties, and reactions of matter. It deals with atoms, molecules, elements, and compounds and their interactions. Basically, if it involves molecules and how they interact, that’s chemistry!
- - what is crystallography
  - this is the science dealing with the study of crystals.
- - what is avogadro s number
  - it is the number of molecules per mole.  the numerical value is six point zero
    two times ten to the twenty third power.
- - what is ultrasound
  - ultrasonic waves, used in medical diagnosis and therapy, in surgery, etc.
- - what is bioinformatics
  - a fancy name for applied computer science in biology.
- - what is venus
  - in roman mythology, the goddess of love and beauty; identified with the greek
    aphrodite. the brightest, sixth-largest planet in the solar system and the second
    in distance from the sun, with a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a very
    high surface temperature.
- - what is ichthyology
  - we talk about this when we study fishes.
- - what is h2o
  - h is to o as o is to v.
- - what is cytology
  - the study of cells.
- - what is cytology
  - well, from what i can recall it is the study of cells.
- - what is cytology
  - Cytology is the study of cells! It's a branch of biology that deals with the structure, function, and behavior of cells. Cytologists study all kinds of cells, from the tiny bacteria that live in your gut to the massive nerve cells in your brain.
- - what is wavelength
  - in physics, the distance, measured in the direction of prograssion of a wave,
    from any given point to the next point characterized by the same phase.  or is
    could be looked at as a way of thinking.
- - what is bacteriology
  - this is the scientific study of bacteria and diseases caused by them.
- - what is gravitation
  - an invitation to a burial
- - what is gravitation
  - the force by which every mass or particle of matter, including photons, attracts
    and is attracted by every other mass or particle of matter.
- - we are on the same wavelength
  - and the same frequency.
- - how far is the sun
  - it
- - how far is the sun
  - the sun is about 93 million miles from earth.
- - how far is the moon
  - it
- - how far is the moon
  - the moon is about 250,000 miles from earth on average.
- - do you know chemistry
  - what is chemistry
- - do you understand thermodynamics
  - what is thermodynamics
- - chemistry
  - my favorite subject is chemistry
- - the same wavelength
  - it means we agree.
- - tell me about venus
  -  Venus, the planet named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It's the second planet from the Sun and its often called our “sister planet” because of its similar size and composition to Earth. But don’t be fooled by its name—Venus is actually a harsh and extreme planet!
